# 📚 Data Structures in C++

This repository contains **C++ implementations** of fundamental data structures. Each structure is implemented from scratch to deepen understanding of how they work internally. It serves as a helpful resource for students, developers, and those preparing for technical interviews.

## 🧱 Implemented Data Structures

- 📦 **Stack**
  - LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure
  - Implemented using arrays or linked lists

- 📥 **Queue**
  - FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure
  - Includes standard queue operations

- 🔗 **Linked List**
  - **Singly Linked List**
  - **Forward List** (optimized version of singly linked list)

- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - Insertion, deletion, traversal (pre-order)

- 🧵 **String**
  - Custom string operations like reversal, concatenation, comparison

- 🗺️ **Map**
  - Key-value store implemented using BST or custom logic

- #️⃣ **Hash Table**
  - Basic hash map implementation with collision handling
